  //
  // The panel runs on three sites. Server collection drives the Discord DOM and
  // is meaningless elsewhere; creator collection reads YouTube's or TikTok's own
  // data and is meaningless on Discord. So the tab matching the current site is
  // the one that can actually run, and the other explains where to go.

  // Creator platforms the Creators tab can be pointed at. YouTube and TikTok have
  // collectors behind them; the others are listed as unavailable so the
  // dropdown shows where this is going without pretending they work — they are
  // rendered disabled and cannot be selected.
  //
  // The ORDER is prospecting priority, not implementation status, and is
  // deliberately not "the working one first". SpokPay sells to lojistas moving
  // Robux for BRL, and that behaviour is advertised most openly on Instagram
  // (sellers publishing a WhatsApp/PIX contact) and TikTok, with YouTube read
  // mainly for the business email on the About page. Listing them in the order
  // they matter commercially is what stops the dropdown from implying YouTube is
  // the best channel rather than merely the built one — so do not re-sort this by
  // `available`.
  //
  // `site` is the SITE value the platform's collector needs, and `host` is what
  // the operator is told to open. Adding a platform later means writing its

  // refuses to parse anywhere else. The feed answers in ISO 8601 regardless.

  // Same shape as the YouTube sweep — discover, gate on freshness, read the

  //
  //   • Profile pages (`/@handle`) are server-rendered. The HTML carries a
  //     `__UNIVERSAL_DATA_FOR_REHYDRATION__` JSON blob whose `webapp.user-detail`
  //     scope holds the whole profile: id, bio, bio link, follower / like / video
  //     counts. A plain same-origin fetch reads it — verified even logged out.
  //
  //   • Search results and hashtag feeds are in NO HTML: the app asks
  //     `/api/...` for them. Those endpoints demand request
  //     signatures (`X-Bogus`, `X-Gnarly`, `msToken`) and answer an unsigned
  //     request with HTTP 200 and an EMPTY body rather than an error. TikTok's
  //     own security SDK wraps the page's `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest` and signs the
  //     same-origin calls made through them, and `@grant none` runs this script
  //     in the page, so its `fetch` IS the wrapped one. The script never builds
  //     a signature itself: if the SDK stops signing, the empty reply is
  //     detected and reported, not worked around.
  //

  // or hashtag page the operator already has open instead — see ttScreenPass.

               component backgrounds, 400-600 borders, 700-800 solid fills,
               900-1000 text. background-100 is every element, background-200
               the well (the log body).
             - Type is one preset per element (heading / label / copy / button),
               never size + weight composed by hand. Nothing under 12px.
             - Radius 6px for controls, 8px for cards, 12px for the floating
               panel, full for dots and badges.
             - Only the panel floats, so only the panel has a shadow. */
